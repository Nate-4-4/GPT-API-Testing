## Usage
Basic usage instructions

### OpenAI Product Key

A product key is used to acess the openAI API. This is how they bill you. It is important that the key is not published on here (or anywhere else public) so that random people do not spend our money. Right now I have it set up so that they key is read from a local file *key.txt* that is included in .gitignore. If you want to use or work on the code I can give you my key or you can [get your own](https://platform.openai.com), just ask me on teams.
